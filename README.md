**for Speaker Verification**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this repository, the wavLM model is used for quality and poor quality data for speaker verification task, and the PyCM library is used for evaluation.

## General Info
***
- **Datasets**: In this review, 30 speakers have been selected from the  [Farsdat Dataset](https://catalogue.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0380/),
  10 speakers is chosen for test as unknows and the rest of speakers as known (target/untarget) 
  each speakers has 10 audio files we use the first audio file as Enrollment file
  *audio files should be 6 secs (here we use ffmpeg to cut them)*
- **Evaluation**: For the evaluation part, the [PyCM](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/pycm/tree/dev) library has been used, which is a reliable and comprehensive library and supports many metrics
  [PyCM](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/pycm/tree/dev) is a multi-class confusion matrix library written in Python that supports both input data vectors and direct matrix, and a proper tool for post-classification model evaluation that    supports most classes and overall statistics parameters. PyCM is the swiss-army knife of confusion matrices, targeted mainly at data scientists that need a broad array of metrics for predictive models and accurate evaluation of a 
   large variety of classifiers.

- **System Config**: To fine-tune this model, [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060-12 GB](https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/) is used.
